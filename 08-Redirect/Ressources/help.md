# Redirect Link Vulnerability

Inspecting the page, there are some elements with the attribute `href="index.php?page=redirect&site=xxxxxx"`.

By changing the destination page, an attacker can redirect users to a malicious site.

## How to Prevent Redirect Link Vulnerabilities

1. **Validate URLs:** Ensure that the URLs in the `href` attribute are valid and belong to trusted domains.
2. **Use a Whitelist:** Only allow redirection to a predefined list of trusted URLs.
3. **Sanitize Input:** Remove any potentially dangerous characters or patterns from user input.
4. **Implement User Confirmation:** Prompt users to confirm before redirecting them to an external site.
